Supabase is a flexible platform that lets you decide how you want to build your projects. You can use the Dashboard directly to get up and running quickly, or use a proper local setup. We suggest you work locally and deploy your changes to a linked project on the [Supabase Platform](https://app.supabase.io/).

Doing things directly on the platform via the [Dashboard](https://app.supabase.io/) is fine when you're getting started, but it's a good idea to move to a proper local workflow before you get too far. Working locally, generating migrations as you change your tables, and applying those migrations to a linked project on the [Platform](https://app.supabase.io/) keeps everything nicely organized as you grow.

## Why develop locally?

The Dashboard provides a wide range of features for setting up your project: creating tables, adding columns, changing existing columns, creating views, setting up RLS policies, and more. Given all of the Dashboard's capabilities, you might question the need to work locally. Here's a few advantages to working this way:

1. **Faster Development**: Developing locally allows you to work without any network latency or internet disruptions.

2. **Easier Collaboration**: Developing locally can make it easier to collaborate with others on the same project.

3. **Cost-Effective**: Supabase provides a generous Free Plan and gives you two free projects to get started. But what if you need more than two? When you develop locally, you can spin up unlimited local projects and link them with live projects when you're ready to launch.

4. **Configuration in code**: If you directly change your tables via the Dashboard, none of that gets captured in code. If you follow these local development practices, you'll store all of your table schemas in code.

5. **Work offline**: Need to work from a train? A plane? An automobile? No problem. Developing your project locally allows you to work offline.

## Access your project's services

You can now visit your local Dashboard at [http://localhost:54323](http://localhost:54323), and access the database directly with any Postgres client via `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres`.

<Tabs
  scrollable
  size="small"
  type="underlined"
  defaultActiveId="postgres"
  queryGroup="access-method"
>
<TabPanel id="postgres" label="Postgres">

```sh
# Default URL:
postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres
```

The local Postgres instance can be accessed through [`psql`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html)
or any other Postgres client, such as [pgadmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/).

For example:

```bash
psql 'postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres'
```

<Admonition type="note">

To access the database from an edge function in your local Supabase setup, replace `localhost` with `host.docker.internal`.

</Admonition>

</TabPanel>
<TabPanel id="kong" label="API Gateway">

```sh
# Default URL:
http://localhost:54321
```

If you are accessing these services without the client libraries, you may need to pass the client keys as an `Authorization` header.
Learn more about [JWT headers](/docs/learn/auth-deep-dive/auth-deep-dive-jwts).

```sh
curl 'http://localhost:54321/rest/v1/' \
    -H "apikey: <anon key>" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <anon key>"

http://localhost:54321/rest/v1/           # REST (PostgREST)
http://localhost:54321/realtime/v1/       # Realtime
http://localhost:54321/storage/v1/        # Storage
http://localhost:54321/auth/v1/           # Auth (GoTrue)
```

`<anon key>` is provided when you run the command `supabase start`.

## Deploy your project

You've been developing your project locally, making changes to your tables via migrations. It's time to deploy your project to the Supabase Platform and start scaling up to millions of users! Head over to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/dashboard) and create a new project to deploy to.

### Link your project

Associate your project with your remote project using [`supabase link`](/docs/reference/cli/usage#supabase-link).

```bash
supabase link --project-ref <project-id>
# You can get <project-id> from your project's dashboard URL: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/<project-id>

supabase db pull
# Capture any changes that you have made to your remote database before you went through the steps above
# If you have not made any changes to the remote database, skip this step
```

`supabase/migrations` is now populated with a migration in `<timestamp>_remote_schema.sql`.
This migration captures any changes required for your local database to match the schema of your remote Supabase project.

Review the generated migration file and once happy, apply the changes to your local instance:

```bash
# To apply the new migration to your local database:
supabase migration up

# To reset your local database completely:
supabase db reset
```

<Admonition type="note">

There are a few commands required to link your project. We are in the process of consolidating these commands into a single command. Bear with us!

</Admonition>

### Deploy database changes

Deploy any local database migrations using [`db push`](/docs/reference/cli/usage#supabase-db-push):

```sh
supabase db push
```

Visiting your live project on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/dashboard), you'll see a new `employees` table, complete with the `department` column you added in the second migration above.

### Deploy Edge Functions

If your project uses Edge Functions, you can deploy these using [`functions deploy`](/docs/reference/cli/usage#supabase-functions-deploy):

```sh
supabase functions deploy <function_name>
```

### Use Auth locally

To use Auth locally, update your project's `supabase/config.toml` file that gets created after running `supabase init`. Add any providers you want, and set enabled to `true`.

```bash supabase/config.toml
[auth.external.github]
enabled = true
client_id = "env(SUPABASE_AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID)"
secret = "env(SUPABASE_AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET)"
redirect_uri = "http://localhost:54321/auth/v1/callback"
```

As a best practice, any secret values should be loaded from environment variables. You can add them to `.env` file in your project's root directory for the CLI to automatically substitute them.

```bash .env
SUPABASE_AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="redacted"
SUPABASE_AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET="redacted"
```

For these changes to take effect, you need to run `supabase stop` and `supabase start` again.

If you have additional triggers or RLS policies defined on your `auth` schema, you can pull them as a migration file locally.

```bash
supabase db pull --schema auth
```

### Sync storage buckets

Your RLS policies on storage buckets can be pulled locally by specifying `storage` schema. For example,

```bash
supabase db pull --schema storage
```

The buckets and objects themselves are rows in the storage schema so they won't be pulled automatically.

### Local logging

Local logs rely on the Supabase Analytics Server which accesses the docker logging driver by either volume mounting `/var/run/docker.sock` domain socket on Linux and macOS, or exposing `tcp://localhost:2375` daemon socket on Windows. These settings must be configured manually after [installing](/docs/guides/cli/getting-started#installing-the-supabase-cli) the Supabase CLI.

<Admonition type="note">

For advanced logs analysis using the Logs Explorer, it is advised to use the BigQuery backend instead of the default Postgres backend. Read about the steps [here](/docs/reference/self-hosting-analytics/introduction#bigquery).

</Admonition>

All logs will be stored in the local database under the `_analytics` schema.

## Limitations and considerations

The local development environment is not as feature-complete as the Supabase Platform. Here are some of the differences:

- You cannot update your project settings in the Dashboard. This must be done using the local config file.
- The CLI version determines the local version of Studio used, so make sure you keep your local [Supabase CLI up to date](https://github.com/supabase/cli#getting-started). We're constantly adding new features and bug fixes.

# Logical Replication and Change Data Capture (CDC)

You have launched your app. You want to understand what works and what doesn't so you start some queries and soon notice that your queries are taking minutes or that you need to combine these data with another system you are using. Not to worry, you are in the right place.

## Read Replicas

[Read-Replicas](/guides/platform/read-replicas) are available on Supabase and allow you to create a second database that is a direct, read-only copy of your primary database that stays in sync. This can be great for many things, like load-balancing, and, in this case, they can be great for analytics workloads.

## Logical Replication

Your use case might go beyond what a Read-Replica can offer and you may need to replicate your data from Supabase into a Data Warehouse, like Clickhouse or Google BigQuery. This could be because of long running queries, the amount of data or because you need to combine your Supabase data with data from other systems.

This is done using a method called [Logical Replication](/guides/database/replication-cdc/logical-replication).

In most cases you will want to use a tool, such as Estuary or Airbyte or Fivetran, to susbscribe to your database, capture the changes and write them to a destination of your choice, ranging from S3 to  Google BigQuery to Google Sheets to Salesforce.

Regardless of the tool you choose, it is very likely you will be using logical replication, so make sure you read the [introduction]((/guides/database/replication-cdc/logical-replication) to that, as well as the [FAQ](/guides/databae/replication-cdc/faq)

To learn how to configure Supabase with a specific tool, select a services from the navigation menu.

<Admonition type="caution">

S3 API compatibility is in alpha and is not intended for production use cases yet.

</Admonition>

Supabase Storage has initial support for the S3 API, allowing you to use S3-compatible tools directly with Supabase Storage.

### AWS S3 CLI

Add the following profile to your `~/.aws/credentials`:

```
[supabase-storage]
aws_access_key_id = TENANT_REF
aws_secret_access_key = SERVICE_KEY
region=ap-southeast-1
endpoint_url= https://TENANT_REF.supabase.co/storage/v1/s3/
```

When using the S3 CLI, you can specify the profile like this:

`AWS_PROFILE=supabase-storage aws s3 ls`

This will list all of the buckets in your project.

### Support for Other Tools

There are a number of popular S3 compatible tools available and, while we would love to support them all, the early stage of this feature means that we are focusing on a core set of tools first.

Primarily, the `AWS S3` CLI and our `S3` [Foreign Data Wrapper](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/wrappers/s3) are the focus.

If you find tools working, or not working, please report them in the [Github Discussion](Link TBC) and we will ensure it stays up to date.
